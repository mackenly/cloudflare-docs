For Universal certificates, Cloudflare controls the validity periods and certificate authorities (CAs), making sure that renewal always occur.

:::note[Partial setup and DCV]
If you are on a [partial setup](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/enable-universal-ssl/#partial-dns-setup), make sure [Domain control validation (DCV)](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/) is configured correctly. Refer to [Troubleshooting DCV](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/troubleshooting/) for further help.
:::

Universal certificates issued by Let's Encrypt, Google Trust Services, or SSL.com have a 90-day validity period. Cloudflare no longer uses DigiCert for newly issued Universal certificates and, for existing ones, the validity period is being adjusted from one year to 90 days.

For 90-day certificates, the auto renewal period starts 30 days before expiration.
